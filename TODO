THINGS TO BE DONE
=================

Add automake/autoconf support

   Detect Guile, GSL, LAPACK; install into proper directory.


Support Guile 1.6 handling of dynamically linked libraries


Expand GSL support

  Properly integrate functions reading/writing to file, ntuple, siman,
  odeiv, minimization over multiple dimensions, constants, error
  handling form of special functions, nonlinear least squares fitting.


Expand LAPACK support

  Add all simple drivers for linear equations, standard and
  generalized linear least squares problems, standard eigenvalue and
  singular value problems.


High level Scheme interface

  Abstract away the low level allocation/deallocation routines and
  improve integration with Guile.


Bugs

  Look into protecting GSL structures from Guile's garbage collector.
  Currently, this problem has only surfaced once in conjunction with
  root finding over multiple dimensions.
