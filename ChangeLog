	* debian/*: Debian support.

	* sound/sndfile.i: Added with-sound-from-file, with-sound-to-file
	as Schemy ways of dealing with the low-level libsndfile interface
	for opening/closing files.  These functions are still a bit light
	on checking memory allocation and file opening.

	* sound/conversion.scm: Added missing constants.

	* signal/test-*.scm: Separated tests from main module files.

	* signal/butter.scm: New modules (signal butter), for Butterworth
	filters.

	* math/const.scm: New module (math const), for mathematical
	constants.
